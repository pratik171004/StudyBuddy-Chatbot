# 💬 Intelligent Chatbot using Python and NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to recognize user intent and provide accurate, relevant responses. It combines rule-based logic with a pre-trained generative language model and is deployed using Streamlit for interactive user experience.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the significance of chatbots in automating conversations.
- Build an intent-based chatbot using NLP techniques.
- Use ML and deep learning models (e.g., DialoGPT) for generating responses.
- Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- Train and test the chatbot with a structured JSON dataset.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Load intents from a structured JSON file.
   - Clean and vectorize the input using TF-IDF.
  
2. **Intent Detection**
   - Use cosine similarity or ML classification to match user input to intent.

3. **Response Generation**
   - For known intents, reply using predefined responses.
   - For unknown input, fallback to DialoGPT for generative response.

4. **User Interface**
   - Streamlit-based frontend lets users type queries and receive responses in real-time.
