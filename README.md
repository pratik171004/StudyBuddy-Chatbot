💬 Intelligent Chatbot using Python and NLP
📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on developing an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries in a conversational manner. Built using Python, the chatbot combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to interpret user intents and deliver relevant responses. The project leverages both rule-based intent recognition and a generative language model for human-like interaction.

The chatbot is deployed using Streamlit, providing a clean and interactive web-based user interface for real-time conversations.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a conversational chatbot that can handle user queries intelligently.

Train the bot using intent-based structured data (intents.json) and generative response modeling.

Integrate NLP techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity.

Enhance interaction using a pre-trained language model like DialoGPT.

Deploy the chatbot in a web interface using Streamlit.

⚙️ How It Works
Data Preparation

The intents.json file contains sample user inputs mapped to specific intents.

Each intent is associated with a list of patterns and appropriate responses.

Intent Recognition

Text input is cleaned and transformed using TF-IDF vectorization.

Cosine similarity is used to match user input with the closest predefined intent.

Response Generation

If intent is matched, a random predefined response is given.

For unmatched or casual queries, DialoGPT is used to generate human-like replies.

Frontend Interface

The chatbot UI is built using Streamlit, allowing users to type queries and view responses in real-time.
